Telegram Scraper

Getting Started

Create a new Telegram application by going to https://my.telegram.org/auth and following the instructions.
Once your application is created, you will receive an API ID and API Hash.
Update the API_ID and API_HASH variables in the code with your newly generated values.
Update the SOURCE_CHANNEL variable with the ID of the source channel you want to scrape from.
Update the DESTINATION_CHANNEL variable with the ID of the destination channel you want to send the scraped messages to.
Prerequisites

Install the telethon library using pip: pip install telethon
Run the script using Python: python filename.py
Usage

Run the script by calling python filename.py in your terminal or command prompt.
The script will scrape messages from the source channel and send them to the destination channel.
Note

Make sure to replace API_ID, API_HASH, SOURCE_CHANNEL, and DESTINATION_CHANNEL with your actual values.
Also, make sure to check the terms of service of Telegram before using this script to scrape messages.
